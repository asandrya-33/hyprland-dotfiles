# hyprland-dotfiles
This is my hyprland rice for linux using a rice with my own personal tweaks :3 

The only things you should really have to do is update your monitor settings, language settings, wallpaper, and make sure all the required packages are installed if i missed anything i will add an update to this section. everything else should be preference :P 
enjoy!

you can make sure everything is installed by doing 

$ sudo pacman -S hyprland hyprshot hyprpaper wofi waybar ly kitty
